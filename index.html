            <p>Today, Bailey went on her very first boat ride. She had a full on Titanic moment, the wind blowing in her fur as she felt like the queen of the world! Not to my surprise at all, fearless Bailey adored being on the boat. The gentle rocking of the boat didn't faze her one bit; she seemed to embrace the new experience with her usual adventurous spirit. She enjoyed watching jetskis, tubers, and other boats go by. She was also curious about the other creatures living in the water or flying above in the sky.
